what is ph
A measure of acidity or alkalinity of water soluble substances (pH stands for 'potential of Hydrogen'). A pH value is a number from 1 to 14, with 7 as the middle (neutral) point. Values below 7 indicate acidity which increases as the number decreases, 1 being the most acidic.

studies have shown that maintaining a slightly alkaline diet is key to good health, as it helps to reduce morbidity and mortality from various health symptoms and chronic diseases including vitamin D deficiency (very common amongst people that work indoors), diabetes, arthritis, low bone density, and more.  
The pH scale, running from 0 to 14, measures the acidity/alkalinity of any substance, with 0 being the most acidic, 7 being neutral, and 14 being alkaline. To maintain good health, our bodies need to achieve a pH level near 7.4—that is, slightly alkaline (hence the name alkaline diet). If we start to depart too much from this level, then various enzymes in our bodies will not function properly

Dental erosion (DE) is the chemical dissolution of tooth structure in the absence of bacteria when the environment is acidic (pH < 4.0). Recent studies indicate that low pH is the primary determinant of beverage erosive potential although citrate chelation of calcium ions may contribute to erosion at higher pH.

The majority (93%, 355/380) of beverages had a pH below 4.0 and 7% (25/380) had a pH ≥4. Relative beverage erosivity zones based on previous studies of apatite solubility in acid indicated: 39% (150/380) of the beverages were considered extremely erosive (pH <3.0); 54% (205/380) were considered erosive (pH 3.0 to 3.99); 7% (25/380) were considered minimally erosive (pH ≥4.0).
